I am a doctoral researcher at the Institute of Geodesy (IfE), Leibniz Univerisity Hannover. 

Currently, I'm with the research training group (RTG) **Integrity and Collaboration in Dynamic Sensor Networks** (i.c.sens, GRK 2159), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). In the RTG, my research topic is *Bounding and Propagating Uncertainty with Interval Mathematics*. The aim is to investigate the uncertainty for GNSS with interval mathematics and set theory, based on which, an alternative integrity approach will be developed for future autonomous navigation applications.

Before joining IfE and i.c.sens, I earned my Master of Science degree in [Earth Oriented Space and Science Technology (ESPACE)](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/iapg/espace/) from Technical University of Munich (TUM). I defended my Master's thesis on *Precise Point Positioning with Ambiguity Resolution for Different GNSS Signals* under the supervision of [Prof. Urs Hugentobler](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/iapg/espace/lecturers/hugentobler/) and [Dr. Bingbing Duan](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/iapg/mitarbeiter/duan/) in 2020.
