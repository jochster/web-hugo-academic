GNSS integrity monitoring requires proper bounding to characterize all major ranging error sources. Unlike classical approaches based on probabilistic assumptions, the alternative integrity approach depends on deterministic interval bounds as inputs. The intrinsically linear propagated intervals are adequate to describe the remaining systematic uncertainty. In order to determine the improved observation interval bounds, a processing scheme is proposed and validated in this contribution. This will contribute to a realistic uncertainty assessment of GNSS-based single point positioning.
