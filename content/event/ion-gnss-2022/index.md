title: Advances in Deterministic Approaches for Bounding Uncertainty and
  Integrity Monitoring of Autonomous Navigation
abstract: "Critical issues for the integrity monitoring of any autonomous
  navigation applications include adequate uncertainty budget in the observation
  domain, the redundancy for the determination of the navigational states, as
  well as the capability of fault detection and exclusion (FDE). Purely
  statistical evaluation of integrity will not always be adequate due to the
  presence of remaining systematic uncertainty. This paper aims to contribute to
  the alternative integrity approach based on interval and set-representations
  for bounding and propagating system uncertainty. Several key aspects are
  addressed: how to determine interval bounds to handle GNSS multipath effect in
  urban environment, how to realize fault detection and exclusion based on
  constraint satisfaction and set-membership, and how to improve the detector
  using weighting models. Simulated and real-world experiments are carried out
  to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed methods. In this way, the
  alternative integrity approach will contribute to future autonomous navigation
  applications."
