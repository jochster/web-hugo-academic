As a research staff at Institut für Erdmessung (IfE), I am offering opportunities for **master's thesis** and **Studienarbeit**. Students of the master's program *Geodesy and Geoinformation*, as well as other programs at Leibniz University Hannover are welcome to reach out in case of interest.

Currently, the following topics are open, which, nevertheless, are not necessarily predetermined and can be adapted to your own preferences and ideas. Please note that I will only supervise English-written theses.
