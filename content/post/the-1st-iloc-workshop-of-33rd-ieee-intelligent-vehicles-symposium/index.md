On June 5th, we successfully organized the first iLoc workshop of 33rd IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium in the course of i.c.sens, titled "iLoc: High-integrity Localization for Automated Vehicles".

Details can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/iloc-2022/).

I was honored to co-chair the afternoon sessions 'Integrity Concepts for IV' and 'Concepts and Algorithms', and additionally present my recent research "Deterministic approaches for bounding GNSS uncertainty: A comparative analysis" in the morning session 'Integrity for GNSS and Integrated Sensors'.

The introduction to the talk can be found [here](https://sujingyao.netlify.app/talk/talk-at-iloc-workshop-of-ieee-iv-2022/).
