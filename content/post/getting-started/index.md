On June 5th, we successfully organized the first iLoc workshop of 33rd IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium in the course of i.c.sens, titled "iLoc: High-integrity Localization for Automated Vehicles".

Details can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/iloc-2022/).

I was honored to co-chair the afternoon sessions and additionally present my recent research "Deterministic approaches for bounding GNSS uncertainty: A comparative analysis".
