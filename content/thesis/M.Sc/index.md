My Master's thesis at the [Institute for Astronomical and Physical Geodesy (IAPG)](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/iapg/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), under the supervision of Prof. Urs Hugentobler and Dr. Bingbing Duan.

# Background

Carrier-phase integer ambiguity resolution (AR) is the key to the fast and high-precision GNSS positioning and navigation. To make use of undifferenced GNSS observations for precise point positioning applications, the method of Zero-difference Ambiguity Resolution is proposed, developed, and now being widely applied in precise GNSS studies. Many researchers and groups have investigated various realization approaches by means of generating GNSS satellite biases, orbit and clock products for PPP users. TUM, as one of the IGS MGEX analysis centers, is also estimating such precise satellite products in their strategy.
