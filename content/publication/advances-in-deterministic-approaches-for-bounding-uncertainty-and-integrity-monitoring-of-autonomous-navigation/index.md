summary: "In this contribution, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of
  applying the alternative integrity approach to autonomous navigation in terms
  of several key aspects, i.e., the handling of GNSS multipath effect in the
  urban environment, fault detection and exclusion, and further consideration of
  applying weighting models. "
