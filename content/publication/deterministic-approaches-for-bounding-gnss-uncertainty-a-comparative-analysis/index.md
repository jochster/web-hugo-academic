abstract: Uncertainty modeling and bounding are of vital importance for
  high-integrity GNSS applications. Classical approaches are mostly developed in
  a stochastic manner with probabilistic assumptions. However, the exact error
  distribution is often unknown, and remaining systematics may persist, so that
  a purely stochastic modeling of all error sources will not be adequate, and
  alternative uncertainty bounding and propagation should be studied. This paper
  introduces two deterministic approaches for GNSS uncertainty bounding and
  compares them with the conventional least-squares method theoretically and
  experimentally with simulated and real measurements. Both methods use
  deterministic intervals to denote observation uncertainty, subsequently
  following a linear uncertainty propagation instead of quadratic one. The
  interval extension of least-squares transfers the uncertainty into the
  position domain in the form of zonotope and further bound the stochasticity by
  the extended point confidence domain. As a comparison, the other method takes
  advantage of geometrical constraints and convex optimization, leading to a
  polytopic solution set and zonotopic confidence region. We show their
  theoretical similarities and highlight different interpretations in practice.
  Nevertheless, both are sufficient to account for both random and systematic
  components of uncertainty.
