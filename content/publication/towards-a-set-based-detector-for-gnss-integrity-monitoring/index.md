abstract: This paper aims to evaluate the performance of the set-based fault
  detection. This approach differs from probabilistic residual-based (RB) or
  solution separation (SS) fault detection and exclusion methods utilized in the
  Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) and Advanced RAIM. In the
  basic positioning model, measurement-level intervals are constructed based on
  the investigated error models and propagated in a linear manner using interval
  mathematics and set theory. Convex polytope solutions provide a measure of
  observation consistency formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem.
  Consistency checks performed using set operations facilitate multiple-fault
  detection. Choosing set-emptiness as the detection criterion can alleviate the
  need for multiple test statistics. In this paper, we formulate the fault
  detection problem in the context of measurement intervals and propose a
  framework of integrity monitoring for the set-based detection. Considering a
  probabilistic error model, we implement the set-based detection methods and
  assess its integrity performance using Monte Carlo simulations. These
  evaluations will serve as a basis for further development of efficient
  estimators and integrity monitors.
